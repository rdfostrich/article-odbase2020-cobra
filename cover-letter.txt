To the Editors of the Semantic Web Journal

Dear Editors,

Please find attached to this letter our submission entitled
"Optimizing Storage of RDF Archives using Bidirectional Delta Chains"
for the call for full papers.
In this article, we introduce a novel technique for storing RDF archives using bidirectional delta chains,
which solves a major scalability issue in existing RDF archiving systems.

In particular, the main contributions of this work are:
* a bidirectional storage technique with an ingestion algorithm;
* querying algorithms for three different version query types on this storage technique;
* an open-source implementation of this technique and the querying algorithms;
* an extensive evaluation of our approach using an existing RDF archiving benchmark.

We hope this article is a good fit for this journal.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us.
We look forward to hearing back from you and thank you in advance
for considering the publication of this work in the Semantic Web Journal.

Sincerely,
Ruben Taelman
